## About Me
I am a second year Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University. I study memory as a function of aging and investigate compensatory strategies that may help offset age-related changes in cognitive performance. As part of my training, I am working to develop and refine my skills in data science and quantitative methods. In my free time, I like to explore new places (not during pandemics though!) and try out new recipes.
