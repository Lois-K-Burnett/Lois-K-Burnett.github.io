## About Me
I am a third year Cognitive Science Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University. I study memory as a function of aging and investigate compensatory strategies that may help offset age-related changes in cognitive performance. As part of my training, I am working to develop and refine my skills in data science and quantitative methods.
